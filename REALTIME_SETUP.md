## How It Works

1. **Connection**: Frontend automatically connects to Socket.IO server on load
2. **Real-time Events**: Backend emits events when data changes (user created, request approved, etc.)
3. **Auto Updates**: Frontend listens to these events and updates the UI automatically
4. **Live Indicators**: Visual indicators show when data is live and updating

## Events Emitted

### User Events
- `newUser` - When a new user is created
- `userUpdated` - When user data is modified
- `userDeleted` - When a user is deleted

### Request Events
- `newRequest` - When a new request is submitted
- `requestUpdated` - When a request is approved
- `requestDeleted` - When a request is rejected/deleted

## Testing Real-Time Updates

1. Open admin panel in multiple browser tabs
2. Approve/reject a request in one tab
3. See instant updates in all other tabs
4. Create new users and see live statistics update
5. Check the live indicator (green pulsing dot) showing active connection

The admin panel now provides real-time updates without requiring page refreshes!
